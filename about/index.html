    Hello <br> I'm Zach
</h1>

<p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to check out my website!
This is a place where I try to put all (or at least some) of my completed
projects so that other people can see them. I also try to write a little bit on
the blog here, though I can&rsquo;t make any promises about the consistency of quality
from post to post. What I&rsquo;m interested in writing about varies wildly from month
to month, so there is very little cohesion in theme.</p>
<p>As for myself, I a recent graduate of Swarthmore College, with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. I was awarded high honors through Swarthmore&rsquo;s unique honors program, which was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. This involved a series of seminars on graduate level math topics teaching both the academic maturity to self study and communication skills to participate in a highly collaborative setting. In my post college time I&rsquo;m focusing mostly on finding work, but I continue to self study mathematics and work on personal programming projects. I intend to return to graduate school some time in the next couple of years to pursue a PhD in either mathematics or deep learning. For more information here is my <a href="/static/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
