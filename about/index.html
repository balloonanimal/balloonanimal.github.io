<h1>
    Hello.
    <br>
    My name is Zach.
</h1>
<p>
    <p>But enough about me, thank <strong>you</strong> for taking the time to check out my website!
This is a place where I try to put all (or at least some) of my completed
projects so that other people can see them. I also try to write a little bit on
the blog here, though I can&rsquo;t make any promises about the consistency of quality
from post to post. What I&rsquo;m interested in writing about varies wildly from month
to month, so there is very little cohesion in theme.</p>

<p>As for myself, I am currently in my senior year at Swarthmore College, studying
Mathematics and Computer Science. For the moment I&rsquo;m focusing a lot of my time
on getting hired so that I have something to do after college. After that I&rsquo;m
going to study and prepare for the honors exams I need to complete at the end of
my Mathematics major. I intend to work in Machine Learning for a few years after
graduation before returning to graduate school to pursue a PhD in Deep Learning.
For more information here is my <a href="/static/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
